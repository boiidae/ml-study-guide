# Building First Predictive Models

This repository contains foundational work exploring the Iris Flower dataset with an emphasis on statistics, data grouping, and vector-based scoring.

## Objectives
- Reinforce descriptive statistics using Pandas
- Practice grouping and aggregation for structured datasets
- Apply linear algebra concepts (dot product) to real data

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `data/iris_clean.csv` – Cleaned dataset used in the notebooks

## Key Concepts
- Central tendency (mean, median)
- Grouped aggregation
- Feature vectors and scalar scoring

This project forms the mathematical and conceptual basis for building classifiers such as logistic regression in later stages.
